The webpage allows the users to enter purchase details and personal details remotely without directly heading to the head offices.During the physical visit into the stores,the customers details are already in the companies database. This eases the clearance procedure and within no time the buyer walks out with a brand new vehicle. In the near future the company is seeking to expand the webpage and add new features that can enable the customer to even get home delivery of the vehicle,the company also provides spares parts for its vehicle brands,so the company wants to enable purchasing of the spare parts online . One of the major challenges that may face the webpage is security,the personal details of the customer may be accessed by high end hackers. We are coming up with new methods to curb this malicious act.

Additionally, addressing customer concerns and resolving issues in a timely manner is crucial for maintaining a positive reputation and fostering long-term customer loyalty.
